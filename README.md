# Code for Pys-TaLiRo


# Installation

We use the Poetry tool which is a dependency management and packaging tool in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. Please follow the installation of poetry at [https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

After you've installed poetry, you can install partx by running the following command in the root of the project: 

```
poetry install
```
